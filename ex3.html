    <p>
      <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.

    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
    <p><img src="coding_picture.jpg" width="100%"></p>
    <p style="margin-top:45px;">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <span class="js">JavaScript</span> APIs for I/O.

    <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

    Although Java and <span class="js">JavaScript</span> are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.</p>
